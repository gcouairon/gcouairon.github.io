- I am a big fan of educational videos on YouTube. I have created the website [YTMap](https://ytmap.github.io/) which is a manually curated and organized set of videos I like most, along with a clean and distract-free interface to watch them on.

- I am passionate about music, especially jazz/funk improvisation and electronic music composition. You can find a list of my compositions on [SoundCloud](https://souncloud.com/phazmusic/)
